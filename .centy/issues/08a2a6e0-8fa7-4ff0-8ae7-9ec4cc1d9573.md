# Pre-commit: add cspell spell check

Run `cspell` against staged files in the pre-commit hook so spelling errors are caught before they are committed.

## Requirements

* Install `cspell` (e.g. via `npm install -g cspell` or as a dev dependency)
* In the pre-commit hook, run `cspell --config .centy/cspell.json` against staged `*.rs` and other text files
* Fail the commit if any unknown words are found
* Display which file and word triggered the failure so the author knows to either fix the word or add it to `.centy/cspell.json`
