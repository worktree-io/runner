# Add disk logging

Currently the application only outputs to stderr/stdout via eprintln!/println!. Add persistent disk logging so that logs from background/GUI-launched processes (e.g. via AppleScript) can be reviewed after the fact.\n\nSuggested log path: follow platform conventions (e.g. ~/Library/Logs/worktree-runner/ on macOS, ~/.local/share/worktree/logs/ on Linux).\n\nConsider using the `log` + `env_logger` or `tracing` + `tracing-subscriber` crates with a file appender.
