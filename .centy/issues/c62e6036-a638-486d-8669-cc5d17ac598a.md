# Pre-push: enforce 100% test coverage

Run tests with coverage instrumentation in the pre-push hook and block the push if coverage drops below 100%.

## Requirements

* Use `cargo-llvm-cov` (or `cargo-tarpaulin`) to measure line/branch coverage
* Fail the push if total coverage is below 100%
* Print a summary showing which lines/functions are uncovered so the author knows what to test
* Cache the coverage tool installation to avoid re-downloading on every push
* Provide a way to skip the check locally (e.g. `SKIP_COVERAGE=1 git push`) for situations where a quick push is needed
