# Pre-commit: run `cargo clippy` lint check

Run `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` in the pre-commit hook to catch lint issues before they are committed.

## Requirements

* Add a `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` step to the pre-commit hook
* Fail the commit if any warnings or errors are reported
* Optionally run with `--all-targets --all-features` to cover tests and examples as well
