# Pre-push: add `cargo build` check

Run `cargo build` in the pre-push hook to ensure the project compiles before any commits reach the remote.

## Requirements

* Add a `cargo build` step to the pre-push hook
* Fail the push if the build fails
* Consider building in release mode (`cargo build --release`) or keeping it as debug for speed
* Print a clear error message indicating the build failure so the author knows the push was blocked
