# CI/CD: Publish release artifacts to GitHub

Add a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically builds and publishes release artifacts when a version tag is pushed.

## Requirements

* Trigger on push of version tags (e.g. `v*`)
* Build binaries for all target platforms (Linux x86_64, Linux aarch64, macOS x86_64, macOS aarch64, Windows x86_64)
* Cross-compile using `cross` or GitHub-hosted runners per platform
* Strip binaries and compress artifacts (e.g. `.tar.gz` for Unix, `.zip` for Windows)
* Create a GitHub Release with the tag and auto-generated or manual release notes
* Upload all artifacts as release assets
* (Optional) Publish to crates.io if applicable
